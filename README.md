# Data_cleaning_1
We performed a data cleaning process on a CSV file containing Influencers data. 

1. Imported the necessary CSV file.
2. Verified the columns present in the dataset.
3. Created a new dataset containing only the relevant columns for further analysis.
4. Identified and examined the rows with null values in the location columns.
5. Handled the null values by filling them with appropriate values such as 'NA' or 0, depending on the column.
6. Converted the data type of the followers and voters columns from float to int to ensure consistency.
7. Cleaned the location column, ensuring consistent formatting and removing any unwanted characters.
8. Created a new column named 'reac_comm' that represents the total reactions and comments on each post, and sorted the column accordingly.
9. Generated a pivot table combining the Location and name columns, providing the total followers for each influencer.
10. Constructed a separate table for hashtags, cleaning the hashtags column and determining the number of hashtags used.
11. Updated the dataset with the newly cleaned data.
12. Downloaded the cleaned data for further analysis and storage.

Graphs were created to visualize the data as follows:
 
13. Generated a line graph to depict the total time spent across all locations.
14. Utilized an area graph to visualize the total 'reac_comm' (reactions and comments) across different media types.
15. Developed a line graph showcasing the total number of hashtags used by each influencer.
16. Re-created the previous graph, this time presenting it as a bar chart, providing additional details such as the names of the influencers.
17. Constructed a bar graph illustrating the total number of followers for each influencer.
